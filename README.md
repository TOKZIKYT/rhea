## Introduction
The Rhea Project reimagines content creation by leveraging OpenAI's Chat GPT, image generation capabilities of DALL-E, and speech recognition technology. This comprehensive approach enables Rhea to generate textual summaries, product reviews, code snippets, AI-generated images, and transcribed audio/speech, providing users with a sophisticated and personalized content experience.

## Features
- **Textual Summaries**: Generate concise and informative summaries from larger texts.
- **Product Reviews**: Create detailed and coherent product reviews.
- **Code Snippets**: Generate code snippets for various programming languages.
- **AI-Generated Images**: Create images based on textual descriptions using DALL-E.
- **Audio/Speech Transcriptions**: Transcribe audio and speech into text.

## Installation
To get started with the Rhea Project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rhea-project.git
   cd rhea-project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Make sure you have PHP installed on your system. You can install the necessary PHP dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your OpenAI API keys (see [API Keys Configuration](#api-keys-configuration) for details).

4. **Run the project**:
   Start the development server by running:
   ```bash
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```

## Usage
Once the project is set up, you can access the Rhea platform via your web browser at `http://localhost:8000`. From here, you can interact with the various features of the platform, including generating text, images, and transcriptions.

## API Keys Configuration
To use the OpenAI services, you need to configure your API keys. Add the following lines to your `.env` file:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

Replace `your_openai_api_key` with your actual OpenAI API key. You can obtain an API key by signing up on the [OpenAI website](https://beta.openai.com/signup/).

## Technologies Used
- **PHP**: The primary programming language used for the backend.
- **OpenAI GPT-3**: For natural language processing and text generation.
- **OpenAI DALL-E**: For image generation based on textual descriptions.
- **OpenAI Whisper**: For audio and speech transcription.
- **Composer**: Dependency management for PHP.
